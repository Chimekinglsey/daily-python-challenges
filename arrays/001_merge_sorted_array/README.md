## Problem 1: Merge Sorted Array

### Problem Statement

**Difficulty**: Easy  
**Topics**: Arrays, Two Pointers, Sorting  

You are given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, sorted in non-decreasing order, and two integers `m` and `n`, representing the number of elements in `nums1` and `nums2` respectively.

Merge `nums1` and `nums2` into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order. The result should be stored inside `nums1`. 

To accommodate this:
- `nums1` has a length of `m + n`, where the first `m` elements are the elements to be merged, and the last `n` elements are initialized to `0` and should be ignored.
- `nums2` has a length of `n`.

#### Example 1
```plaintext
Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3, nums2 = [2,5,6], n = 3  
Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6]
Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [1,2,3] and [2,5,6].
The result of the merge is [1,2,2,3,5,6] with the underlined elements coming from nums1.
```

#### Example 2
```plaintext
Input: nums1 = [1], m = 1, nums2 = [], n = 0  
Output: [1]
Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [1] and [].
The result of the merge is [1].
```

#### Example 3
```plaintext
Input: nums1 = [0], m = 0, nums2 = [1], n = 1  
Output: [1]
Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [] and [1].
The result of the merge is [1].
```

#### Constraints
- `nums1.length == m + n`
- `nums2.length == n`
- `0 <= m, n <= 200`
- `1 <= m + n <= 200`
- `-10^9 <= nums1[i], nums2[j] <= 10^9`

#### Follow-Up
Can you come up with an algorithm that runs in **O(m + n)** time?
